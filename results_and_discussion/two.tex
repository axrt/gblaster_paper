\subsection{Horizontal origin of Ankyrins in Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria}
Jernigan and Bordenstein [22] showed that the lifestyle of bacteria, rather
than phylogenetic history, is a predictor of ANK repeat abundance. They also
showed that phylogenetically unrelated organisms that forge facultative and
obligate symbioses with eukaryotes show enrichment for ANK repeats in
comparison to free-living bacteria. This observation was especially strong for
obligate intracellular bacteria. Ankyrin domains are very common in eukaryotes,
but rare in bacteria, with the exception of parasites and symbionts. In a paper
by Siozios et al. [23] it is concluded that ankyrin genes are likely to be
horizontally transferred between strains with the aid of bacteriophages.
Al-Khodor et al. [24] also suggests that prokaryotic genes encoding
ANK-containing proteins have been acquired from eukaryotes by horizontal gene
transfer. This finding was independently reproduced in our analysis that
suggests that both species of endosymbiotic Wolbachia included in our study
have genes encoding ANK-containing proteins acquired via HGT by their
ancestors.
