\subsection{Horizontal origins of Thaumatins in nematodes} Taumatins
are a group of defensive proteins produced by plants in response to fungal
infections [link]. Recently the presence of these proteins was reported in the
desert locust \textit{Schistocerca gregaria}, one related species, and in the
nematode \textit{Caenorhabditis} but not in \textit{Drosophila} and also some
insects \cite{Brandazza2004}. Our analysis suggests that the ancestors of
\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} may have acquired Thaumatin \cite{Vigers1992}
proteins via HGT.  According to InterPRO \cite{Finn2017} there are currently
4853 known Thaumatin proteins (IPR001938). 3179 of them are found in land
plants, 1120 in Fungi and only 118 in Metazoa. The latter 118 are distributed
among nematodes (59 proteins), panarthropods (57 proteins) and mollusks (2
proteins). This distribution of Thaumatin proteins among the tree of life
favors the idea that HGT was involved in their evolution.
