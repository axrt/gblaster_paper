\subsection{Horizontal origins of Taumatins in nematodes and insects}
Taumatins are a group of defensive proteins produced by plants in response to
fungal infections, some of which are characterized as “sweet” by humans [link].
Recently the presence of these proteins was reported in the desert locust
Schistocerca gregaria, a related species \textit{Locusta migratoria} and in the
nematode \textit{Caenorhabditis} but not in \textit{Drosophila} and other insects
\cite{Brandazza2004}. Our analysis suggests that \textit{Tribolium castaneum}
and \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} have Thaumatin proteins, which were
previously acquired via HGT. According to InterPRO \cite{Finn2017} there are
currently 4853 known Thaumatin proteins (IPR001938). 3179 of them are found in
land plants, 1120 in Fungi and only 118 in Metazoa. These 118 are distributed
between nematodes (59 proteins), panarthropods (57 proteins) and mollusks (2
proteins). This distribution of Thaumatin proteins among the tree of life
favors the idea that HGT was involved in their evolution.
