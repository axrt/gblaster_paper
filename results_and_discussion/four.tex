\subsection{HGT genes detected in Archaeon Loki}
Archaeon Loki was reported as a complex archaea that bridges the gap between
prokaryotes and eukaryotes [27]. Our initial analysis revealed sequences of one
domains that is overrepresented among candidates for HGT in Archaeon Loki:
MaoC\_dehydratas. All 7 Maoc\_dehydratas containing proteins of Archaeon Loki are
not similar to any proteins found in archaea, but share some degree of
similarity to proteins found in d-proteobacteria according to a simple BlastP
search (e-values up to E-15).
