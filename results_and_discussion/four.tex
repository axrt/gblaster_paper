\subsection{HGT genes detected in \textit{Archaeon Loki}} \textit{Archaeon
Loki} was reported as a complex archaea that bridges the gap between
prokaryotes and eukaryotes \cite{Spang2015}. Our initial analysis revealed
sequences of domains that are overrepresented among candidates for HGT in
\textit{Archaeon Loki}: MaoC\_dehydratas, Ras, Roc, Arf, LRR\_8. For example,
the Maoc\_dehydratase domain is present in 7 PPS of \textit{Archaeon Loki}. All
of them were classified as outsiders by multiple models. Meanwhile only 64 PPS
of \textit{Archaeon Loki} have this classification. 79 PPS are classified as
"outsider once" and 1409 as "always core". This distribution is unlikely under
the null hypothesis that Maoc\_dehydratas are equally likely to be classified
as core or outsiders (p = 5,64E-08). All 7 Maoc\_dehydratas containing proteins
of \textit{Archaeon Loki} are not similar to any proteins found in archaea, but
share some degree of similarity to proteins found in d-proteobacteria according
to a simple BLASTP search (e-values up to E-15).  Ras proteins are involved in
cellular differentiation, proliferation and survival, and are present in the
vast majority of metazoa, but are rarely found in prokaryotes (IPR001806) which
gives additional support to the HGT hypothesis. In a similar way Roc and Arf
domains are universal for eukaryotes, not prokaryotes. For an example, refer to the
distribution among different groups of organisms for Arf (PFAM: PF00025).
