\section{Introduction}
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is widely accepted as an important factor in the evolution of prokaryotic organisms [1]. At the domain-of-life-scale, a number of HGT events between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and even between different eukaryotic species have been described, and in some cases have revealed molecular mechanisms that facilitate transmission [2]. For example, agrobacteria are widely used in modern biotechnology because of their natural ability to transfer some of their genes horizontally into plant genomes [3]. Plants with genes of bacterial origin are thus not uncommon [4][5, 6].
Another peculiar case is the acquisition of genes by arthropods from bacterial endosymbionts. For instance, the genome of the Callosobruchus chinensis beetle contains around 30% of the Wolbachia genome [8].
Viruses may also contribute to lateral gene transfer [9]. A particular gene of retroviral origin encoding a protein called “syncytin” plays an important role in mammalian placenta morphogenesis [10].
There is some evidence that HGT can occur between different eukaryotic species [2], for example between certain parasitic plants and their hosts [12-15], but overall our knowledge of this field is scarce
There is ongoing controversy about the extent to which HGT plays a role in eukaryotic evolution. Numerous examples of HGT were found in different eukaryotic species, including humans by Crisp et al [16]. However, other researchers failed to confirm some of the published HGT findings [17]. A study by Ku et al concluded that even gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes is only episodic, but coincides with major evolutionary transitions such as the origin of chloroplasts and mitochondria [18]. It should be noted that Ku et al analyzed eukaryotic gene families with prokaryotic homologs and used clustering and phylogenetic analysis to drive this conclusion. Crisp et al on the other hand used differences in blast bit-scores between prokaryotic and non-prokaryotic best hits of eukaryotic genes as a criterion for the identification of probable HGT events. Thus, these studies are quite different by design, including the formulated requirements for HGT. So far, no apparent consensus seems to exist among the scientific community  of what constitutes sufficient evidence for HGT.
Here we present a novel regression-analysis-based approach for the identification of HGT events in genomic sequences based,and report our findings of putative HGT events in 61 genomes covering different branches of the tree of life using the proposed method.
