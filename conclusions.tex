\section{Conclusions}
We developed a novel approach capable of detecting candidate sequences for HGT.
Novel cases of putative HGT were identified in most studied species (excluding:
species name, species name, species name). We performed a systematic search for
PFAM domains associated with candidate HGT sequences and found a number of
highly overrepresented entries. Some of these entries are well-studied examples
of HGT, while others have not been reported before. We created a downloadable
database that contains all sequences, that were flagged as candidates for HGT.
Two important limitations of our approach should be noted: we are unable to
discern HGT from genomic contaminations using this method and it is
computationally slow.
