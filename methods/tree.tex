\subsection{PFAM analysis}
Each protein-coding sequence with hits in 3 or more other genomes was analyzed using PFAM [21]. For each genome, we compared the number of genes with each discovered PFAM domain between the core and outsider multiple sequences. We used a chi-square test to assess whether any domains were significantly over- or underrepresented among outsider multiple sequences. We considered p-values of 5.5 x 10-7 to be statistically significant (a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied to account for 89688 domain/species combinations used in the analysis). Note that technically this is not a strict statistical procedure, since similar genes will have similar arrays of bit scores and our classification of these genes will not be independent. Similarly, this does not distinguish multiple HGT events of sequences containing the same PFAM domain from a single HGT event followed by multiple gene duplications. Main findings were evaluated manually.
