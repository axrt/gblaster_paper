\subsection{Genomes and protein-coding regions used}
\label{gen_n_prot_cod_regs}
We used publicly available nucleotide sequences of 61 genomes from major
domains of life (Supplement 1). Since these genomes had varying annotation
coverage, we adhered to a heuristic approach: each genome was searched for
putative open reading frames (ORF) of minimum length 150 b.p., and those
putative ORFs were used as proxies to potentially existing protein coding
sequences. These putative protein-coding sequences (PPS) may or may not be
parts of existing genes, or may be translated only partially as splicing was
not taken into account. As a result, for each genome considered we created a
set of PPSs for all six coding frames.
