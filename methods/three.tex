\subsection{Domain analysis}
\label{domain_analysis}
We used PFAM-A \cite{Finn2014} database and HMMER \cite{Prakash2017} to search
for known domains in all PPSs with 3 or more hits in other genomes.  For each
genome, we compared the number of genes with each discovered PFAM domain
between the core and outsider sequences (those that have been classified as
outsider in at least one regression analysis).  We used a chi-square test to
assess whether any domains were significantly over- or underrepresented among
outsider multiple sequences.  We considered p-values of 5.86E-07=0.005/85254 to
be statistically significant (a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
was applied to account for 85252 domain/species combinations used in the
analysis). Note that technically this is not a strict statistical procedure,
since similar genes will have similar arrays of bit scores and our
classification of these genes will not be independent. Similarly, this does not
distinguish multiple HGT events of sequences containing the same PFAM domain
from a single HGT event followed by multiple gene duplications. Main findings
were evaluated manually.
